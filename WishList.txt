Things we want the app to do (in order of priority). Add anything to the list at any time

Implement one database table
Add entries

Delete entries -- all of these are gonna be queries I guess
	undo last one
	scroll thru list of date/price/type and select
	within a date range (specify purchase type, or don't)

Get total spending (for all, for certain category, for multiple categories)
	(-oo, oo)
	(-oo, x]
	[x, oo)
	[x, y]

Make a graph of spending activity -- they enter paramters, we query the data and make a graph
