Things we want the app to do (in order of priority). Add anything to the list at any time

Implement one database table
Add entries
Delete entries -- all of these are gonna be queries I guess
	undo last one
	scroll thru list of date/price/type and select
	within a date range (specify purchase type, or don't)
Make a graph of activity -- they enter paramters, we query the data and make a graph
